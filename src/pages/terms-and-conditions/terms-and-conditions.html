Object - About Us
Xobaedi Sàrl is a Swiss limited liability corporation doing business as Xobaedi (collectively referred to herein, together with its corporate affiliates, as "Xobaedi", "Us", "We" or the "Company"). Our mission is to Bringing Ideas and Collaborative Innovation to Life. Xobaedi is the producer, operator and owner of the PROTOPIDEA, which is a collaborative web and cloud based application that lets users (the “User” or “Users”) to submit ideas (scientific or non-scientific), inventions and intellectual property (the “IP”) for potential feedback and collaboration with Xobaedi and/or with the Community for the possibility of development, production, commercialisation, licensing and/or sale. This Service also directly and/or indirectly includes creative and professional talent advertising, marketing and promotions of the User’s personal information and submissions to promote potential collaboration with other Members and/or Investors and/or Companies. Xobaedi is the owner of the product, Site and APP called PROTOPIDEA, which provides the same service and is available on Google Play, Apple App store and over the web browser. 

Basic Description of User Involvement and Participating to the Service
The Site and the APP is developed and is still being developed constantly for improvements. As the Site and the APP is not fully operational at this point in time there is limited or no activities performed from/on the Site. Please note that we are operating with limited members, so at this point not all features and benefits are visible or obvious yet. We thank you for your consideration and patience. 
Ideas, Prototypes, Products and Posts
Ideas, Prototypes, Products and Posts (collectively the “IPPP”) covers all prototypes, product, service, scientific or non-scientific ideas including but not limited to, all texts and multi-media files that are submitted by the User, are viewable to selected members who are invited by the User or are given access by Xobaedi. All IPPP are viewable by selected staff of Xobaedi. 
Xobaedi reserves the right to create algorithms to post, re-post or share IPPP submissions automatically on its platform or other websites and social media platforms for commercial purposes. 
Once an IPPP is submitted by the User, the Company reserves right to use it for its commercial purposes. These commercial purposes include, but are not limited to:
a. Marketing 
b. Promoting and developing the Company’s Products,
c. Commercialisation
d. Production
e. Licencing
f. Sale objectives of Xobaedi.
The Company may in its sole discretion and at any time reject or remove an IPPP from its Site. The User and the submitter of the IPPP (the “IPPP Submitter”) may have the possibility to invite other Users to collaborate in small groups to run a series transformation called Digital Prototyping Processing (the “DPP”). 
•    DPP subjects the IPPP through a series of simple phases where there is potential involvement between collaborators and Xobaedi.
•    It is the sole responsibility of the User to restrict the disclosure of any confidential IPPP over the course of the DPP. The User assumes full responsibility and the risk of loss, resulting from his own disclosure of IPPP to the other Users and the collaborators.

•    The creators of the ideas (“Idea Creators”) are urged to start collaborating as soon as possible to accelerate the innovation process and to bring their ideas to life through DPP.
•    Once the collaboration phase is completed and the prototype is ready to be submitted to the Company, the prototype shall be classified as a Collaborative Digital Prototype (the “CDP”) in which the Company will evaluate and may choose to commercialise. The selection, sale, and commercialisation of any CDPs are subject to the Company’s sole and absolute discretion. The Company reserves the right for any or no reason, to reject to commercialise and sell a CDP. 
•    Prior to the commercialisation of a CDP, the Company has the right to modify the content of the CDP in order to increase its potential commercial value. A CDP that undergoes a final modification or final improvement will then be classified as a Final Digital Prototype (the “FDP”). Irregardless before a CDP is commercialised it will be reclassified as a FDP.
•    Pre-Commercialisation and commercialisation of the CDP or FDP can take any or all of the various forms listed below:

a) Marketing
b) Promoting
c) Selling and/or licensing the CDP or FDP (inclusive of all IP Rights)
d) Manufacturing
e) Physical Prototyping

The Company has the right to commercialize or start the pre-commercialization phase of a CDP or FDP at any point in time in which the Company sees fit.  User’s IP rights are protected as stipulated in the Intellectual Property Contractual Rights part of these Term of Use.

•    Dependent of the commercialisation value of the CDP or FDP, decided one by one in every case a majority of the equity paid by the third parties as a value of the prototype shall be distributed to the Collaborators and the creators of the CDP or FDP. 
•    If during the process of commercialisation of the CDP or FDP that the commercialisation is unsuccessful for any reason what so ever or in the Company’s sole discretion decides to discontinue the process of commercialisation, at any time the Company takes no ownership or any liabilities what so ever of such an occurrence.
•    At the Company’s sole discretion it may decide not to commercialise the CDP or FDP without reason.

Intellectual Property and Equity
Collaborators will receive remuneration depending on different criteria mentioned below, these criteria merely act as a reference and by no means taken as the absolute rule:
Type of work submitted
Quality of work
Content of work
Completion of work
Feedback from collaborators

Once a Prototype has a purchaser, it is the Company’s sole discretion to decide the details of selling, including the exact price of the CDP or FDP. 

If after 2 years from the completion of the FDP, there are no longer any significant activities by the Collaborators or the Company on the FDP, the Company will return all IP rights to the individual Collaborators. Please refer to the IP Contractual Rights for more information.

Collaborators will receive the selling price. However, this amount can be a bit less for certain reasons, depending on the circumstances in every project, but has to be the majority of the exact selling price.

After the commercialisation of the CDP or FDP the Company will decide on the potential amount of equity each User or Collaborator involved will receive. This decision is final, non-negotiable and cannot be disputed. 

In the event there are IP rights distributions coming from the CDP or FDP, the Company will again have full authority and rights to distribute the sharing of any such IP rights to the User or Collaborators at Our own digression.

All distribution of equity, IP rights or any commercial rights are strictly confidential and will not be disclosed by the Company to the User, Collaborator or anyone directly or indirectly related to the CDP, FDP or the Site or APP in general. The User is adviced not to disclosed and information concerning the received equity as this may cause potential unsatisfactory situations amongst the collaborators.  

Dependent of the commercialisation value of the CDP or FDP, the majority of the equity will be distributed back to every Collaborator of the CDP or FDP. The Company will retain a portion of the equity and/or IP rights as payment to the task of pre-commercialising and commercialisation of the CDP or FDP.

If during the process of commercialisation of the CDP or FDP that the commercialisation is unsuccessful for any reason what so ever or in the Company’s sole discretion decides to discontinue the process of commercialisation, at any time the Company takes no ownership or any liabilities what so ever of such an occurrence.

As the distribution of equity or IP rights is a very sensitive manner and potentially unequal to individual Collaborators, every User is prohibited in sharing their equity or IP rights gained with other Users or to anyone else directly or indirectly involved in the collaboration or use of the Site or the APP.
Intellectual Property Contractual Rights
With using our Service your work can be protected in two ways.
Process Protection
Once the Collaboration has started, all Collaborators will work on their own part in the project and all Users and Collaborators are bound by Xobaedi`s Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”). Collaborators are adviced to only share information required to ensure that the CDP be completed. Collaborators are not required to share all their works to any or all other Collaborators.
Upon completion of the User’s work or portion of work towards the Prototype, all works submitted by the User will be only accessable to the User itself.  Only selected employees of Xobaedi will have access, where they are bound by confidentiality obligations.
Intellectual Property Protection
Once a CDP or FDP is completed the User may take or have the option to register their works with various intellectual property type options. Please note that registering your product or service for IP protection is not mandatory but is advisable to do as it may provide a higher level of security and a potential higher selling price for the FDP.  At any time the Company takes no ownership or any liabilities what so ever on the decision of the User here.

As our Service is not a legal platform we are not responsible to perform any IP registrations process of the CDP or FDP. However, our legal department may and on a case to case basis provide general intellectual property advice or strategy, but We are not liable for any information which may be not accurate or incorrect in any way.
In connection with the general IP advice We would like to emphasize that the most cost-effective intellectual property form for patentable products is the provisional patent application (the “PPA”) in the USA, which is highly recommended for the User to protect their works. This PPA may help in establishing priority rights for the User for a relatively low cost and with minimum formalities.

The User takes full responsible to decide if any IP protection is required for their works at any point in time. Upon request by the User, the Company may redirect Users to the Company’s IP legal partners. Please note that in all cases the User bears all IP protection cost or any other cost directly or indirectly associated to this.

Once a CDP or FDP is completed, Xobaedi will have sole all exclusive rights for all technologies and intellectual property rights regarding the CDP or FDP for two years. This includes all works submitted through this Service by the User at any point in time irregardless of if the CDP or FDP is completed, in this scenario the starting date of the 2 year exclusivity rights starts from the last works submission date by the User.

The User is obligated to provide Xobaedi all necessary files and documentation required to complete the CDP or FDP.
“Technology” means any technologies in connection with the CDP or FDP and all Technical Information without limitation. 

“Technical Information” means all know-how and related technical knowledge relating to the CDP or FDP without limitation.

“Intellectual Property Rights” means all Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, System Designs, Design and other intellectual property rights whether registered or not relating to the CDP or FDP; also all trade secrets and other proprietary know-how, public information, non-proprietary know-how and invention disclosures.

“Documents” includes all information fixed in any tangible medium of expression in whatever form or format, and copies thereof; any information of a technical or business nature regardless of its form. Including all documented research, developmental, demonstration or engineering work; information that can be or is used to define a design or process or procedure, produce, support or operate material and equipment and all other drawings, blueprints, patterns, plans, flow charts, equipment, parts lists, software and procedures, specifications, formulas, designs, technical data, descriptions, related instructions, manuals, records and procedures. 

During the marketing, selling and contracting process with potential buyers or investors, Xobaedi will be the Seller, who has the sole exclusive rights to discuss and negotiate alldetails with the buyer including signing of the sales agreement and other related contracts or agreements.
